# Customer Segmentation
This Project is made with the help of the most commonly used clustering algorithm known as K-Means Clustering.
With the help of clustering, we have made clusters of customers depending on the Annual income and spending score.For finding the optimal number of clusters,we have used the Elbow Method which calculates the within cluster sum of squares and plots it with respect to number of clusters.

The number of optimal clusters is found manually which is one of its limitations of this clustering algorithm and in case of overlapping centroids, this algorithm is not suitable. Although, we can use the DBscan for it but here its not used since there was no problem of overlap.
